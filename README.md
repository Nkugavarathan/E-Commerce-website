# 🛍️ Vara Fashion — Full Stack E-Commerce Website (MERN)

### 👗 Your Fashion, Your Style — Anytime, Anywhere  

Vara Fashion is a **fully functional full-stack e-commerce website** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
It allows users to **browse products, create accounts, add items to the cart, and place real orders**, while the **admin dashboard** provides product management, analytics, and order control.

This project demonstrates my **full-stack development, animation, and authentication** skills and is built as a **major showcase project** for internship and professional portfolio purposes.
